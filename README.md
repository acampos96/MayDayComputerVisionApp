# MayDay Computer Vision Android App
Native Android app that allows its users to detect popular products such as Coca-Cola or Pepsi using Machine Learning and the built-in camera.
The App is still in development so you might not see much in the Master branch yet, but you can track all changes in the Development branch, where there is now a functional version.
As of now the app recognizes only 4 brands of products including Coca-cola, Pepsi, Boquitas Diana and Dany.

This app is in the development by a group of students of Computers Engineering at Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas (UCA) in El Salvavor as a project for the class "Aplicaciones Código Abierto"
